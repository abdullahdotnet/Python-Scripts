Abstract—The purpose of the research paper is to identify the
factors that affect the mental health of university students. We
are only interested in IT sector students. Many research papers
are available regarding the mental health of medical students
but relatively fewer reaches are present for IT students. We
gathered data from the different universities in Lahore, Pakistan.
Most students were undergraduates while some were from post-
graduate level as well. We used statistical analysis to identify
the factors influencing student mental health. To identify the
factors,we developed a scale of stress. This scale was built by
using 6 most important features from our dataset and applying
advanced learning techniques. Then we tried to find which factors
are affecting this scale and if there is any significant affect. We
also tried to find correlation between multiple factors such as
finding if high stress affect the CGPA which resulted in negation
that high stress does not affect CGPA in any manner. Also we
tried to find stress management of male and females and if there
is significant difference in their response to stressors. We also
tried to find which activities can help students to release stress.

I. INTRODUCTION
A mental health problem is a health condition that affects
a person’s thoughts, behaviours, emotions, and interpersonal
communication [8]. The most common symptoms in mental
health are depression which is followed by anxiety and stress
levels. The mental health factors can also be influenced by the
psychological and physical problems [8]. Over the past few
years, many research studies have been conducted on public
health, diagnosis, and clinical administration regarding mental
health problems [9].
Students’ mental health problems are a growing concern
in higher education. In recent times, these concerns have
doubled due to the significant socioeconomic, political, and
technological changes in the world. With the emergence of
the ongoing novel COVID-19 pandemic, students in higher
education are faced with increased mental health challenges.
[7]
In COVID-19 pandemic many students faced imminent
threats to their personal health, financial strain and uncer-
tainty, risk of unemployment or redundancy, social distancing
measures and isolation, loneliness and limited access to basic
necessities, such as food and medicine [1]. In today’s era,
college students face mental health issues frequently [3]. In the
past few years we have seen an increase in the symptoms of
depression and anxiety among students, especially in college.
Moreover, not enough research is done which is needed to
understand the causes of these problems [4]. College life is
1

stressful for many students due to the academic workload and
sudden shift towards adulthood responsibilities without having
a certain level of maturity. For instance, some students have to
work for a living and support their families [2]. Race-related
stress impacts entrepreneurship and mental health of students.
[5] Our prime objective is to identify the factors impacting the
student’s mental health using advanced statistical analysis and
machine learning techniques.
II. DEMOGRAPHICS SECTION
We conducted a study using a dataset consisting of, around
100 individuals to evaluate the mental well being of computer
science students. Through analyzing characteristics we gained
a deeper understanding of their overall health. Notably, our
findings indicated that male and female students accounted for
73.3% and 26.7% of the participants respectively. In terms of
age, 32% of the population centered around the age group of
20 years old. Furthermore, our research showed that university
enrollment patterns showcased the prevalence of the University
of Punjab capturing over 63% of participants academic paths.
Examining data from the year revealed a diverse landscape
with first-year students comprising over 37% and third-year
students making up more than 32%.
By evaluating Cumulative Grade Point Averages (CGPA)
which reflect performance we were able to gain insights into
participants achievements in their studies. Around thirty-one
percent of the cohort achieved CGPA scores ranging from
three to five highlighting a portion with academic abilities.
Additionally, our investigation into sports engagement and
lifestyle factors uncovered that over 46% of students were not
actively involved in sports activities raising concerns, about
behaviors. People have expressed worries, about their sleep
patterns with more than half of them saying they typically get
4 to 6 hours of sleep per night which could potentially impact
their well being.
Furthermore, the survey examined how content students
were with their chosen field of study and discovered that over
37% of them felt satisfied. Finally in terms of ways to alleviate
stress an interesting pattern emerged; over 53 percent of
students mentioned engaging in activities as a means to relieve
stress. This detailed account of the demographics provides a
foundation for our study. Paves the way for further exploration
into the intricate connections, between these factors and the
mental well being of computer science students.

Stress Relief Activities.
IV. DISCUSSION
Stress Score:
In our research paper, we aimed to find stress levels using 6
distinct features and advanced machine-learning techniques.
These features were selected based on their relevance to
student’s stress. These features include academic workload,
financial pressure, depression, anxiety, isolation(lack of so-
cialization), and satisfaction with the field of education. We
know that stress can come from many different sources, so we
tried to capture all possible different factors that could impact
students most. We used advanced machine learning algorithms
to analyze a vast amount of data and develop a stress score
system. We further categorized the stress scores into three
distinct levels: low, moderate, and high. The following figure
shows the normally distributed graph of stress score.
Fig. 1: Histogram of stress score
Statistical Analysis:
By applying statistical analysis, we were able to find valuable
insights and factors affecting student’s mental health.
Stress score comparison between genders:
There is a common perception among people that women
are more likely to be stressed than men. Some researchers
support this claim in their research domain. [10]. We can
also find researches that claim both genders equally respond
to stressors. [6]. So we also tried to compare stress among
male and female students. To check if there is any significant
difference in stress levels between male and female students,
2
2024 Mental Health of Computer Science Students Factors Influencing and Statistical Analysis
we plotted the stress score across both genders. The following
figure shows stress scores across male and female students.
Fig. 2: Box plot of stress score across male and female students
As you can see the mean stress score of both genders is
almost the same which suggests that there is no significant
difference in stress scores among male and female students.
To verify this claim, we also performed hypothesis testing
with the following null and alternative hypotheses:
H0: There is no significant difference in stress scores of male
and female students.
H1: There is a significant difference in stress scores of male
and female participants
The T-statistic value is -1.1015 and the calculated p-value
is 0.2777. Assuming a 95% confidence level and using the
p-value test, we failed to reject the null hypothesis that there
is no significant difference between the stress scores of male
and female students.
Our research suggests that both male and female students are
moderately stressed in the IT domain.
Stress score comparison across different years:
We collected data from students of all years of university. We
tried to check whether there is any difference in how students
perceive stress based on their stage in the degree program -
whether they’re just starting, in the middle, or nearing the
end. The following figure shows a box plot of stress scores
across 4 years of university.
It’s interesting to see how stress levels can vary at different
points in a student’s academic journey. It’s interesting to note
that students tend to experience moderate stress during their
first year of college. However, as they become better adjusted
to their new environment during their second year, stress
tends to decrease to a more manageable level. Unfortunately,
the following years seem to bring a resurgence of stress. It is
possible that the uncertainty of the future may contribute to
these increased stress levels. We also used ANOVA analysis
to verify this claim of difference in stress across 4 years of
university. The level of confidence is assumed to be 95%.
The null and alternative hypotheses are the following: H0:
Fig. 3: Box plot of stress score across 4 years of university
There is no significant difference in stress across different
years of university.
H1: There is a significant difference in stress across different
years of university.
The f-statistic value is 3.8954 while the corresponding p-value
is 0.0118 which is smaller than 0.05 which is the alpha
value showing the level of confidence. So we will reject the
null hypothesis. This also verifies that there is a significant
difference in stress across different years of university.
Stress score comparison between on-campus & off-
campus students:
As we collected data from both hostelers and commuter
students so we were intrigued to find whether the struggles of
hostel life impact students’ mental health or not. To find this
we performed an ANOVA analysis on the following null and
alternative hypotheses. H0: There is no significant difference
in stress scores among n-Campus and Off-Campus residents..
H1: There is a significant difference in stress scores among
On-Campus and Off-Campus residents.
The values of the f-statistic and p-value are 0.0043 and 0.9476
respectively. Assuming a confidence level of 95%, we fail to
reject the null hypothesis. With the rejection, we can presume
that there is no significant difference in stress scores among
on-campus and off-campus residents. The following figure
of stress scores among on-campus and off-campus resident
students also tells the same story.
Stress score comparison across different majors: As
there exist multiple majors in the IT domain, so we tried
to compare the 4 most common majors of the IT domain.
As seen in the figure, the mean of stress scores across
all majors varies which suggests that there is a significant
difference in stress scores in different majors. To prove this,
we performed an ANOVA analysis here too with following
null and alternative hypothesis. H0: There is no significant
difference in stress scores across different majors..
H1: There is a significant difference in stress scores across
different majors..

Fig. 4: Box Plot of Stress Score among on-campus and off-
campus students
Fig. 5: Box Plot of Stress Score across different majors
With an F-statistic value of 3.7003 and p-value of 0.015,
we reject the null hypothesis which proves that there is a
significant difference in stress score across different majors.
Correlation between CGPA and Stress Score:
The common sense suggests that if a student is stressed by
studies then it will affect his/her CGPA but during our r&d
process we found that stress does not affect cgpa in any way
so we decided to find out if stress significantly affects CGPA
of students. To find this, the hypotheses are as follows:
H0: There is a significant correlation between CGPA and
Stress Score.
H1: There is no significant correlation between CGPA and
Stress Score.
After correlation test on CGPA and Stress score we found that
there is no significant relationship between CGPA and stress
score which is a quite interesting fact.
Correlation between sports and stress score:
Hypothesis testing for finding the correlation between sports
engagement and stress scores shows that there is no significant
correlation between these two entities. The hypotheses are as
follows:
Fig. 6: Scatter Plot of CGPA & Stress Score
H0: There is no significant correlation between Sports and
Stress Score.
H1: There is a significant correlation between Sports and
Stress Score.
The value of Pearson’s correlation coefficient is -0.1944 and
the calculated p-value is 0.06636. Assuming the level of
confidence to be 95%, and through the p-value test, we fail
to reject the null hypothesis that claims there is a significant
correlation between Sports and Stress Score.
Stress score comparison across different levels of sports:
Although we found that there is no significant correlation
between Sports and Stress Scores, we are also interested
in finding whether there are significant differences in stress
scores among different levels of sports engagement or not.
We categorise students into four categories based on sports
activities. These are no sports, low, moderate and high. Those
students who play sports more than 7 times a month are
categorized as high, 4 to 6 as moderate, 1 to 3 as low and
no sports means they do not play even once a month. The
following figure shows the plotting of these levels based on
stress scores.
Fig. 7: Box Plot of Stress Score by Sports Engagement Level
We used ANOVA analysis to find whether significant
differences occurred among different levels of sports and
stress scores. The level of confidence is assumed to be 95%.
The hypotheses are as follows:
H0: There are no significant differences in stress scores
4
2024 Mental Health of Computer Science Students Factors Influencing and Statistical Analysis
among different levels of sports engagement.
H1: There are significant differences in stress scores among
different levels of sports engagement.
The F-statistic value is 4.6984 while the p-value is 0.004369
which is less than 0.05 of alpha value. Through this hypothesis
testing, we reject the null hypothesis. This gives us the result
that there are significant differences in stress scores among
different levels of sports engagement. We can see a general
trend in the above graph as well for the students, who play
moderate levels of sports have lower stress scores.
Correlation between sleep and stress score:
The next thing we want to figure out is whether sleep and
stress scores have a significant correlation between them. To
test this, we implied hypothesis testing for correlation. We
assumed the level of confidence is 95%. The hypotheses are
as follows:
H0: There is no significant correlation between Sleep and
Stress Score.
H1: There is a significant correlation between Sleep and Stress
Score.
The calculated value of the correlation coefficient is -0.2859
while the p-value is 0.006291. This rejects our null hypothesis.
So we are 95% confident that there exists a significant corre-
lation between sleep and stress score. The following Scatter
Plot shows some level of correlation as well.
Fig. 8: Scatter Plot of Sleep vs Stress Score
Through the above-mentioned analysis, we found that
there is a significant correlation between sleep and stress
scores. The value of correlation is negative which means by
increasing one entity, other thing will decrease. The following
plot also shows that as the number of sleep hours increases,
stress scores overall decrease.
Stress score comparison across different levels of sleep:
To test whether the difference in stress score across different
levels of sleep is significant or not, we used one-way ANOVA
testing. Following are the hypotheses:
H0: No significant differences in stress scores among different
levels of sleep.
Fig. 9: Boxplot of Stress Score Across Different Levels of
Sleep
H1: There are significant differences in stress scores among
different levels of sleep.
The f-statistic value is 3.7373 while the corresponding
p-value is 0.01410 which is smaller than 0.05 which is the
alpha value showing level of confidence. So we will reject
the null hypothesis. This shows that there is a significant
difference between stress score across different levels of sleep.
Stress score comparison across groups of mistreatment
on campus:
Some students may have higher stress score if they experi-
ence mistreatment on campus. The box plot also shows that
those students who experience mistreatment have higher stress
scores.
Fig. 10: Boxplot of Stress Score Across Different Levels of
Sleep
But the question is whether this difference is significant or
not. To verify this, we used hypothesis testing. Let us say the
level of confidence is 95%. The hypotheses are as follows:
H0: No significant differences in stress scores between groups
with and without campus mistreatment.
H1: There is a significant difference in stress scores between
groups with and without campus mistreatment.
5
2024 Mental Health of Computer Science Students Factors Influencing and Statistical Analysis
Through the p-value test, the value of p comes to 0.06156
which is slightly greater than alpha = 0.05. So we fail to
reject the null hypothesis. Although the above figure shows
that there is a difference between stress scores between the
two groups, but hypothesis testing with 95% confidence says
that the difference is not significant.
Association between gender and stress relief activities:
We have seen how different factors affect stress on a student.
We also want to find the association between gender and stress
relief activities. To find this, we used the chi-square test for
this purpose. Let’s say the following are the hypotheses:
H0: There is no significant association between Gender and
Stress Relief Activities.
H1: There is a significant association between Gender and
Stress Relief Activities.
We used the p-value test to verify the claim. The p-value after
the calculation is 0.02297 which is lesser than alpha = 0.05.
So we will reject the null hypothesis. After this hypothesis
testing, we are 95% confident that there exists a significant
association between gender and stress relief activities. Let’s
have a look at the following contingency table for gender and
stress relief activities.
Fig. 11: Contingency Table: Gender vs Stress Relief Activities
The table also shows that there exists a significant depen-
dency between gender and stress relief activities. Both males
and females do mostly religious activities for stress relief.
Males more focus on entertainment and fitness activities while
females focus on social connections and sleep.
V. MACHINE LEARNING
First, it is important to know why machine learning is
helpful in the student’s mental health. We saw several online
healthcare sites that predict a person’s health score and most
of them are based on PSS means Perceived Stress Scale but
these predicting models are for a universal audience. After
several interactions and suggestions from the students, we
feel that it would be great to make a predictive model that is
trained specifically for the computer sector. We plan to design
a model that greatly handles mental health specifically stress
levels and depression among the individuals based on specific
parameters.
Before applying machine learning it is essential to know
about the data. After applying the exploratory data analysis
which you find out in the demographics section there is one
part missing which is the correlation coefficients of all the
features so that it helps us to identify high as well as low
correlated features. The features such as anxiety, isolation,
university workload, academic pressure, and financial pressure
of the students are highly correlated. Following is the heatmap
of all the correlation coefficients sorted from most correlated
to least correlated features.
Fig. 12: Correlation Coefficients
After experimenting with well-known machine learning
models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support
vector machines, we found that random forest is the most
efficient for our dataset. We learned from several sources
that random forest is an ensemble strategy that avoids high
variances and predicts optimal results through hyperparametric
tuning. One of the hidden benefits of random forest is that it
reduces the effort of feature selection and does not require as
much feature preprocessing as other models, without losing
the accuracy.
While doing the hyperparameteric tuning, the main focus
was on the ’n estimator’ which sets the number of decision
trees in the random forest and this is obtained through the
cross-validation method. Our target columns are stress level
and depression level and this is the classification problem.
The stress level is from the range 1 to 3 where 1 means
low stress, 2 means moderate and 3 is high stress. Similarly,
6
2024 Mental Health of Computer Science Students Factors Influencing and Statistical Analysis
the depression level ranges from 1 to 5 representing lowest to
highest depression.
Our model gives approximately 90 percent accuracy after
cross-validation. The one of main features of random forest
is the feature importance. When a model is trained then it
identifies the important features and gives them the weights.
It helps to identify and reduce the number of features by
retaining the model’s accuracy. The following table shows the
features importance of model1 and model2 and are sorted on
their sum scores.

VI. CONCLUSION
We have thoroughly analyzed each student’s mental health
in the computer science domain. Results show that there is no
significant difference between stress scores among males and
females, on-campus and off-campus, with and without campus
mistreatment, and with sports. On the other hand, we have
found that some factors have significant statistical differences
with stress scores which are years of university, university
majors, levels of sports engagements, and sleep. Also, there
is a significant association between Gender and Stress Relief
Activities. In the end, after a deep understanding of mental
health factors, machine learning models are designed to help
identify such students, and these models have an impressive
accuracy of 90 percent.
This study represents a significant advancement in address-
ing mental health concerns and their aftereffects within the
student community.
